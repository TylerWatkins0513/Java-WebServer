This is a java Web Server that does the following:

1. Receive an HTTP request from a web browser.
2. Parse the HTTP request to identify the requested object.
3. Locate the corresponding data in the local folder.
4. Respond with appropriate HTTP responses

To Run this you will need a HTTP Request maker, I recommend the following:

1. HTTP request Maker - FireFox Extension
2. ReqBin API- Google chrome
